// Detects sustained climbing segments in an enriched route (the `distance`
// and `ele` fields added by route.mjs#enrichRoute). A climb keeps extending
// through small dips and only closes once elevation has dropped
// CLIMB_DESCENT_TOLERANCE_METERS below its peak *and* the route has moved on
// past that peak by CLIMB_MERGE_GAP_METERS — so a short flat stretch or a
// few meters of downhill doesn't fragment one climb into many. Candidates
// below CLIMB_MIN_GAIN_METERS of gain or CLIMB_MIN_AVERAGE_GRADE_PERCENT of
// average grade are dropped as not being a "climb" worth reporting.
//
// Each returned climb also carries its start/peak elevation so a live ride
// can work out how much ascent and grade remain partway through it, without
// re-scanning the route.
