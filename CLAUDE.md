# CLAUDE.md — instructions for AI agents working on GPX Rider

GPX Rider is a **no-build, static web app**: plain HTML/CSS/JS ES modules,
no bundler, no framework, no `node_modules`. Keep it that way — do not
introduce a build step, TypeScript, npm dependencies, or a framework unless
the user explicitly asks for one.

## Commands

```sh
make           # default: gallery-data + test (the deploy Action runs the same generation)
make run       # serve the repo (scripts/dev_server.py — a no-cache static server so edits never load stale). Landing page at http://127.0.0.1:5173/app/, the app itself at http://127.0.0.1:5173/app/app.html
make test      # node --test tests/*.test.mjs (no dependencies needed)
make gallery-data  # regenerate app/gallery.json from gallery/*/metadata.json + export.gpx (texts, preview camera, distance/ascent/descent, difficulty, and mini-profile bars)
make rider-dot-model  # regenerate app/assets/rider-dot.glb (the 3D rider marker mesh) — only needed after editing scripts/generate_rider_dot_model.py, not part of the default `make`
```

Always run `make test` after changing anything in `app/`. Browser-only
modules can at least be syntax-checked with `node --check app/<file>.mjs`.

## Architecture

Everything the browser loads lives in `app/`, which is what GitHub Pages
deploys as the site root. `app/index.html` is the **public landing page**
(hero replay + marketing sections, driven by `app/landing.mjs`); its "Launch
GPX Rider" links point to `app.html`, the actual application. `app/app.js` is
the application's only entry point (loaded as a module from `app/app.html`),
and it is deliberately **thin**: it boots the app (`startApp`) and wires DOM
events to the feature modules (`bindEvents`) — nothing else. All shared
mutable state lives in `state.mjs`; every behavior lives in a focused module:

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `app/app.js` | Entry point, deliberately thin: `startApp()` boot sequence + `bindEvents()` DOM event wiring. **No logic lives here** — adding a feature means an import and a listener line, nothing more |
| `app/state.mjs` | Shared app foundation: the single mutable `state` object, the DOM element map `els`, and `updateProgressLabel`. Bottom of the feature import graph — it must never import a feature module |
| `app/map-init.mjs` | Maps API key resolution/saving, Google Maps JS loader, 3D map + minimap creation |
| `app/route-load.mjs` | GPX file/URL intake, `applyGpxText` route-swap sequence, once-per-load route overview (name chip, difficulty tile, climbs list) |
| `app/route-render.mjs` | Map geometry: elevated 3D route lines, rider dot mesh + fallback ring, rider beacon, minimap route/marker (see the rider-dot design notes below) |
| `app/movement.mjs` | The movement loop (`tick`), simulation toggle, pedaling detection/hysteresis, ride reset, seek |
| `app/demo-mode.mjs` | Demo mode UI: drives the ride from `demo.mjs`'s synthetic trainer/HR model, demo chip/banner sync |
| `app/theater-mode.mjs` | Theater mode: pinning the map viewport to the exact recording size |
| `app/ride-ui.mjs` | `updateRideUi`: the per-tick UI driver — per-frame camera/dot work, then slow-cadence DOM stats, progress bars, HUD tiles, dock readouts, ETA |
| `app/profile-ui.mjs` | Elevation profile canvas wiring: rendering + hover/click-to-seek/drag-to-select interactions (drawing math stays in `profile.mjs`) |
| `app/climbs-ui.mjs` | Climb/segment focus (seek + highlight + focused camera), live current/next-climb status, the map HUD climb/segment banner |
| `app/training-zones.mjs` | HR/power zone calculation from the rider profile, fullscreen zone meters, settings zone summaries + help popovers |
| `app/telemetry-ui.mjs` | Trainer/HR telemetry callbacks, HR source-of-truth resolution, calories/ride-timer accessors, telemetry readouts |
| `app/recording-ui.mjs` | FIT buffer card, FIT download, clear-ride-data confirmation (recording itself: `recorder.mjs`; encoding: `fit.mjs`) |
| `app/follow-camera.mjs` | Follow/first-person camera targets, the chase flight (`stepCameraFlight` + loop), terrain avoidance, manual-drag capture |
| `app/overview-camera.mjs` | Overview state machine: static/satellite framing, animated orbit/fly-by/fly-over loop, finish-line orbit, return-to-rider |
| `app/camera-ui.mjs` | Camera UI wiring: map action-bar overview/camera-view controls + menus, Settings › Camera & view sliders, first-person preset, reset-camera button state |
| `app/settings-ui.mjs` | Settings dialog shell (tabs) + every non-camera settings panel: units, rider profile, display & HUD toggles, rendering, screenshot settings |
| `app/map-hud.mjs` | Map HUD & fullscreen surface: clock chip, HUD tile order/visibility + drag-reorder, metric tile layout, data dock collapse, fullscreen enter/exit, map screenshot action |
| `app/camera-debug.mjs` | Camera debug overlay readout + the red overview travel-path debug line |
| `app/gallery-export.mjs` | Export to gallery card: metadata.json snippet with the live preview camera, clipboard copy |
| `app/persistence.mjs` | Settings & saved-ride persistence: `restoreSettings`/`saveSettings`, `restoreSavedRide`/`saveRide` (the one deliberately cross-cutting module) |
| `app/tuning.mjs` | **All tunable behavior parameters**, one documented constant each (defaults, thresholds, model factors). New knobs go here, not inline |
| `app/camera.mjs` | Pure follow-camera math (tested) |
| `app/flyover.mjs` | Pure animated-overview math (tested): orbit turntable camera + orbit debug path |
| `app/flyby.mjs` | Pure loop-flight math (tested): fits a PCA-aligned footprint frame and flies a camera around it — an ellipse (`createEllipseFlyby`, "fly-by") or a figure-eight (`createFigureEightFlyover`, "fly-over"), both sharing one camera eye/look-at + bank driver and the `ELLIPSE_FLYBY` config; minimum turn-radius enforcement and clockwise/counter-clockwise travel |
| `app/geo.mjs` | Pure geodesy helpers: haversine, bearing, destinationPoint, clamp, lerp |
| `app/route.mjs` | GPX parsing, route enrichment (cumulative distance + noise-filtered ascent/descent), point interpolation, grade computation (tested) |
| `app/eta.mjs` | Smart ETA: flat-equivalent pace model estimating remaining ride time (tested) |
| `app/difficulty.mjs` | Route classification from distance + total elevation gain alone: distance/terrain classes and overall difficulty (tested) |
| `app/climbs.mjs` | Detects sustained climbing segments in a route for the setup-page climbs overview (tested) |
| `app/profile.mjs` | Elevation profile canvas drawing + hover/seek/drag-select hit-testing |
| `app/trainer.mjs` | FTMS trainer over Web Bluetooth: pairing, reconnect, control-point writes, Indoor Bike Data parsing (speed, power, calories, HR) |
| `app/heartrate.mjs` | BLE heart-rate strap (standard Heart Rate service 0x180D) |
| `app/recorder.mjs` | Ride "bucket": accumulates samples while moving, persists via `storage.mjs` |
| `app/fit.mjs` | Minimal FIT activity encoder — tags rides as sport=cycling, sub_sport=virtual_activity (tested) |
| `app/units.mjs` | km/mi + kcal/kJ display formatting; internal state is always metric (tested) |
| `app/screenshot.mjs` | One-click JPG of the map viewport via tab capture (`getDisplayMedia`) — the 3D map canvas sits in a closed shadow root and cannot be read directly |
| `app/gallery.mjs` | Fullscreen ride-gallery overlay (`<dialog#galleryDialog>`): route cards from `app/gallery.json` — all stats/card data is precomputed by `generate_gallery_json.py`. Each card starts with a lightweight classic satellite map and route trace; its square `Show 3D` button creates the Photorealistic 3D preview on demand using `metadata.json#previewCamera` (falling back to the normal overview framing). |
| `app/storage.mjs` | Persistence: IndexedDB behind a sync in-memory cache (localStorage fallback + one-time migration; tested) |
| `app/config.mjs` | `deployedMapsApiKey()` — empty in source, rewritten at deploy time (see below) |
| `app/index.html` + `app/landing.mjs` | **Public landing page.** A no-build port of the Claude Design "GPX Rider Landing" prototype: a hero that replays one route (`landing-route.mjs`) over a live Google Photorealistic 3D map with a faked HUD, then a summit orbit, then loops; below it, static marketing sections. Reuses the app's Maps-key resolution (visitor key wins over the deploy-time key), and can optionally show a still fallback via `LANDING_HERO.fallbackImagePath` when no map is available. All hero knobs live in `LANDING_HERO` (`tuning.mjs`). "Launch GPX Rider" deep-links the Ještěd gallery route (`app.html?route=0050_jested`). |
| `app/landing-route.mjs` | Static route data (`[lat, lng, ele]`) the landing hero replays, downsampled from `gallery/0050_jested/export.gpx`. Marketing data, not part of the app runtime |

## Code organization system — how to keep this codebase clean

`app.js` was once a 5000-line monolith; it is now ~300 lines of boot + event
wiring and must stay that way. The rules below are the system that keeps it
so. Follow them mechanically — they are written so that any agent, regardless
of context budget, can make a change without re-deriving the architecture.

### The layers (import direction flows downward only)

1. **`tuning.mjs`** — constants only. Imports nothing app-level.
2. **Pure logic modules** (`geo`, `camera`, `route`, `eta`, `difficulty`,
   `climbs`, `units`, `fit`, `flyby`, `flyover`, `demo`, `route-style`,
   `profile`) — no DOM, no app state, no imports from higher layers. Every
   one of these is unit-testable; most are tested.
3. **Hardware/IO modules** (`trainer`, `heartrate`, `recorder`, `storage`,
   `screenshot`) — own their internal state, talk upward only through
   `init*()` callbacks or plain return values.
4. **`state.mjs`** — the shared mutable `state` object + the `els` DOM map +
   `updateProgressLabel`. It may import only layers 1–3 (in practice:
   `tuning.mjs` and `eta.mjs`). **Never add functions or feature logic here,
   and never make it import a feature module** — it is the bottom of the
   feature graph precisely so everything above can import it freely.
5. **Feature modules** (`*-ui.mjs`, `movement`, `map-init`, `route-load`,
   `route-render`, `follow-camera`, `overview-camera`, `map-hud`,
   `persistence`, …) — import `state`/`els` from `state.mjs`, pure helpers
   from layers 1–3, and *each other's exported functions*. Circular imports
   **between feature modules** are expected and safe because they only export
   top-level function declarations that are called at runtime; what is NOT
   safe is running another feature module's code at module-evaluation time
   (top-level calls, or computing a module-level `const` from another feature
   module). Keep module top levels to imports, constants, and function
   declarations.
6. **`app.js`** — boot (`startApp`) + event wiring (`bindEvents`). Nothing
   else, ever.

### Where does my change go?

- **New behavior** → a new focused module, or the one existing module whose
  header comment names that responsibility. Every module starts with a
  comment stating what it owns; if your change doesn't fit any header, that
  is the signal to create a new module, not to stretch an existing one.
- **New event listener** → the handler lives in a feature module; `app.js`
  gets only the import + `addEventListener` line.
- **New shared state field** → add it to the `state` object in `state.mjs`
  with a comment; new DOM element → add it to `els`. No module-level mutable
  state in feature modules (animation/poll loops keep their "am I running"
  flag on `state`, e.g. `movementLoopActive`).
- **New tunable** → `tuning.mjs`, same change (existing rule, see below).
- **New persisted setting** → four places, all in the same change:
  a `DEFAULT_*` in `tuning.mjs`, the field in `state.mjs`, read+clamp in
  `restoreSettings` and the key in `saveSettings` (`persistence.mjs`), and
  the feature's own `sync*`/`apply*` functions. `persistence.mjs` is the one
  module that is *allowed* to touch everything — persistence is inherently
  cross-cutting; don't try to split it.
- **New pure computation** → its own layer-2 module (or an existing one),
  with unit tests in `tests/`.

### Module hygiene rules

- One module = one responsibility, stated in its header comment. If a module
  needs an "and" in its header that isn't cosmetic, split it.
- Keep feature modules roughly **under 400 lines**. `app.js` stays under
  ~350. A module trending past that is due for a split in the same PR.
- Export **only** what other modules or `bindEvents` actually call; keep
  helpers unexported. When you stop using an import, delete it.
- Never reach around a module's exports (no duplicating a private helper
  from another module — export it or move it).
- `.mjs` extension for all browser modules (`app.js` is the sole exception).

### Verification checklist (run every time, in this order)

1. `node --check app/<file>.mjs` for each file you touched (syntax).
2. `make test` (pure-module regressions).
3. Boot the app in a real browser (`make run`, open
   `http://127.0.0.1:5173/app/app.html`) and check the devtools console:
   **import/export name mismatches and missing imports only surface at
   runtime in a no-build app** — a clean `node --check` does not prove the
   module graph links. Load a route, start the simulation, confirm no
   console errors.
4. If you added/renamed/split a module, update the module table above and
   mirror the edit in `AGENTS.md`.

Tunable parameters (defaults, thresholds, physics/model factors) live in
`app/tuning.mjs` with a doc comment each — never as inline magic values —
so users can adjust behavior in one place. This is not limited to numbers:
file paths, URLs, color strings, orientation/config objects — anything a
user or future contributor might reasonably want to retune belongs in
`tuning.mjs`, not inlined at its call site, even if it's only used once. When
adding a new adjustable behavior, add its constant to `tuning.mjs` in the
same change; don't leave it inline "for now." Deliberate exceptions:
`app/config.mjs` (rewritten at deploy time, see below) and the BLE
write-queue timing internals in `trainer.mjs` (hardware-safety, documented
in place).

## Key domain concepts

- **Two movement sources.** The rider advances along the route from either
  *pedaling* (trainer-reported speed, always wins) or the *simulation*
  (slider speed, toggled by the "Start simulation" button). Starting to
  pedal auto-stops a running simulation; the button must never control the
  trainer-driven movement. Pedaling detection uses hysteresis
  (`PEDALING_START_KPH` / `PEDALING_STOP_KPH` in `tuning.mjs`).
- **The movement loop** (`tick` in `movement.mjs`) runs on requestAnimationFrame
  while the tab is visible and falls back to `setTimeout` when hidden, so
  rides keep advancing and recording in background tabs. Per-tick elapsed
  time is clamped (`MAX_TICK_SECONDS`) to avoid teleporting.
- **Ride recording** is independent of route progress: resetting or seeking
  the route does not touch the recorded bucket. The bucket only grows while
  the rider is actually moving, and it survives reloads via `storage.mjs`
  (IndexedDB — a long ride no longer risks localStorage's ~5 MB quota).
- **FIT export** must stay a *virtual ride* (sport 2 / sub_sport 58) or
  Strava/Garmin will misclassify uploads. `fit.mjs` is a hand-rolled
  little-endian encoder — if you touch it, keep the CRC and header tests
  green and verify a real download parses (e.g. with an online FIT viewer).
- **Ascent/descent & the smart ETA.** `enrichRoute` adds cumulative
  `ascent`/`descent` to every point, noise-filtered by
  `CLIMB_NOISE_THRESHOLD_METERS` so GPX elevation jitter doesn't inflate
  totals; `ascentAt`/`descentAt` interpolate them at any progress distance
  (they feed the ascent progress bar and "ascent left" stats). The ETA
  (`eta.mjs`) measures the rider's pace in *flat-equivalent meters* —
  climbing charged, descending credited (factors in `tuning.mjs`) — and
  projects it onto the remaining route. The estimator is fed **only from
  real pedaling ticks** (simulation speed is artificial and would poison
  it); a pure simulation ETA is plain remaining-distance ÷ slider-speed.
  The estimator resets when a new GPX loads, not on ride reset.
- **UI layout & reusable components.** The app is a dark, single-viewport
  shell (`app.html`): a fixed top bar (brand, GPX chip, Open/Browse/Settings),
  a 3D map filling the left, and a fixed-width right control panel. CSS
  components in `styles.css` are meant to be reused, not re-invented per
  screen: `.btn` (+ `-ghost`/`-blue`/`-accent`/`-outline-*`/`-sm`),
  `.panel-card` (+ `-head`/`-title`/`-hint`), `.stat-grid` + `.stat-tile`,
  `.switch` (the amber toggle used everywhere a checkbox appears in the
  settings dialog), `.setting-row` / `.setting-slider`, `.icon-btn`, and
  `.status-dot`. A global `[hidden] { display: none !important }` rule lets
  the `hidden` attribute win over a component's own `display`. Fonts: Space
  Grotesk (UI), JetBrains Mono / IBM Plex Mono (numbers), Spectral (serif
  titles). The grade palette (green→gray→amber→orange→red) is duplicated in
  three places by design — `profile.mjs#gradeColor`, the gallery generator's
  `generate_gallery_json.py#mini_bar_color` (which bakes the mini-profile bar
  colors into `gallery.json`), and the `.profile-legend` swatches — keep them
  in sync. `gradeColor` is exported and reused (not re-copied) by the
  fullscreen climb banner's mini-profile in `climbs-ui.mjs`; the climb-category chip
  colors in `CLIMB_CATEGORIES` (`tuning.mjs`) track the same palette.
- **Settings dialog.** A single `<dialog#settingsDialog>` with a left
  category rail (`[data-settings-tab]`) and a right panel per category
  (`[data-settings-panel]`); `selectSettingsTab` in `settings-ui.mjs` toggles the
  `active` tab, shows the matching panel, and copies the tab's
  `data-panel-title`/`data-panel-subtitle` into the header. `openSettings(tab)`
  opens on a given category (first-run key prompt opens on `"data"`). All the
  underlying inputs kept their IDs, so the settings-restore/sync code is
  unchanged — only their grouping moved. On phones (the `max-width: 860px`
  block in `styles.css`) the dialog stacks: the rail moves to the top as a
  single horizontally-scrolling tab strip and the category panels fill the
  rest. `.settings-main` carries `min-height: 0` so it shrinks to the fixed
  dialog height and `.settings-body` (`overflow-y: auto`, `overscroll-behavior:
  contain`) is what scrolls — without that the panel content spilled past the
  dialog and the page behind scrolled instead (issue #13). The `"debug"`
  category holds developer-facing toggles (currently the camera-debug overlay,
  below); new diagnostics go there rather than cluttering the user-facing tabs.
- **Camera debug overlay.** A `"debug"` settings toggle
  (`#cameraDebugInput` → `state.cameraDebugEnabled`, persisted, default off via
  `DEFAULT_CAMERA_DEBUG_ENABLED`) shows a translucent readout (`#cameraDebug`,
  a plain map overlay — visible windowed *and* fullscreen, unlike the
  `.fs-*` HUD overlays) of the values the 3D map **actually applies**:
  `state.map.{tilt,range,heading,roll,fov,center}` plus the derived eye altitude
  and ride progress. The readout can be collapsed via
  `#cameraDebugCollapseBtn` (`state.cameraDebugCollapsed`, persisted) while
  keeping the debug overlay active. It exists mainly to compare a requested
  camera against what Google honours after a manual drag (e.g. how far a tilt
  is respected at a given range). While active and the selected overview mode is
  `"orbit"`, `"flyby"` or `"flyover"`, `camera-debug.mjs` also draws that mode's travel path
  as a red `Polyline3DElement` configured by `OVERVIEW_DEBUG_LINE_*`; for orbit
  this is the camera eye's ground track, for fly-by the fitted travel ellipse,
  and for fly-over the fitted figure-eight. It stays visible if the user drags
  the camera into manual mode.
  `renderCameraDebug` rebuilds the rows and
  `startCameraDebugLoop` re-runs it on its own `CAMERA_DEBUG_REFRESH_MS`
  `setTimeout` chain while the overlay is on — a dedicated poll because when
  the user is dragging the camera at rest nothing else steps it. Wired through
  the same `updateDisplaySettingsFromControls`/`syncDisplayControls`/
  `applyDisplaySettings` trio as the other display toggles.
- **Map ride HUD (design 3a).** The ride HUD is part of `#mapViewport` in
  both setup/windowed mode and fullscreen. Entering fullscreen only adds
  `.fullscreen-mode` to `#mapViewport` (making it a fixed, full-bleed
  container); it must not change which HUD overlays are visible. The setup map
  and fullscreen map are intentionally the same map surface with the same HUD
  content, just at different sizes. Do not add CSS that hides `.fs-*` overlays
  outside `.fullscreen-mode`. Three overlays, all fed on the slow-UI cadence
  from `updateRideUi`:
  - **Bottom data dock** (`#fullscreenOverlayBottom` / `.fs-dock`): the metric
    tiles plus the *road-ahead* elevation profile and the distance/climbing
    progress bars. `initializeMapHud` mounts the shared `#profile` canvas into
    `#fsProfileMount` once; the same grade-coloured canvas draws the grade bars,
    axes, ride marker, hover tooltip, click-to-seek, and drag-to-select segment
    highlight in setup and fullscreen. The dock collapses to a compact strip via
    `#dockToggleBtn` (`toggleHudDock` → `.collapsed` class, persisted as
    `hudDockCollapsed`); collapsed hides the road-ahead profile and stacks the
    two progress bars, expanded shows the profile with the bars side-by-side.
    Because a collapsed (display:none) canvas measures 0×0, re-expanding
    re-renders the profile. The road-ahead plot only has height because the
    two rows of metric tiles set the dock's height — the profile is `flex:1`
    within that. On phones (the `max-width: 860px` block in `styles.css`) the
    dock body stacks into a column instead: the fixed-width metric grid becomes
    a four-column `1fr` grid, the separator and road-ahead note are dropped, the
    road plot gets a fixed height (it has no intrinsic height once the body is a
    column), and the collapsed metric strip wraps — otherwise the desktop row
    layout overflows a phone's width. The corner overlays (minimap, clock,
    banner, actions) also pull their insets in and the banner loses its desktop
    `min-width`.
  - **Top-left clock chip** (`#fullscreenClock`): elapsed time (from
    `rideLogSummary().timerSeconds`) + ridden distance, sitting above the
    minimap (which is repositioned in fullscreen).
  - **Top-right controls**: the existing `.map-actions` cluster, plus the
    Settings shortcut (`#mapSettingsShortcutBtn`, class `.map-action-btn-settings`)
    so the same controls are available when fullscreen hides the top bar.
  - **Top-centre climb/segment banner** (`#climbBanner`, `updateFullscreenClimbBanner`):
    reuses `state.climbs`. Shows the *ahead* variant (category chip from
    `CLIMB_CATEGORIES`, countdown, a mini grade-profile built with
    `profile.mjs`'s exported `gradeColor`, length/gain/avg/max) when the next
    climb is within `CLIMB_BANNER_APPROACH_METERS`, and the *on-climb* variant
    (to-top / to-go / current / peak / grade-left, plus two unlabelled
    progress bars — blue = distance, amber = ascent, matching the dock bars)
    while on it. Both variants carry a "climb N of M" ordinal (the climb's
    `findIndex` position + `state.climbs.length`), mirroring the setup page's
    live climb status. Max grade and the mini-profile bars are cached on the climb
    object (climbs are re-detected each route load, so the cache can't
    go stale). If the user drag-selects a custom profile segment while riding,
    this same banner surface switches to the selected segment stats (start, end,
    length, ascent, descent) instead of forcing a camera overview.

  HUD tiles are matched to settings toggles by `data-hud="…"` /
  `data-hud-toggle="…"` keys, which must also exist in `DEFAULT_HUD_ELEMENTS`
  (`tuning.mjs`) — add all three when adding a tile (the toggle markup is a
  `.field-toggle` with a `.switch`; the tile is a `.fs-tile` inside
  `#fullscreenHud` with the matching `data-hud`). `layoutMetricTiles` sizes
  the tiles from the visible count (they flow into two rows and narrow when
  all eight are on). The minimap toggle uses `visibility` (class
  `minimap-hidden`), not `display:none`, so the Google map never needs a
  resize kick when re-shown. Map labels toggle the `Map3DElement.mode`
  between `SATELLITE` and `HYBRID`.
- **Route overview (name + classification + climbs)**: `updateRouteOverview`
  in `route-load.mjs` runs once per route load (GPX import or restoring a saved
  ride), not on every ride-progress tick — it only depends on the route's
  fixed distance/ascent totals and populates `state.routeName`/`state.climbs`
  for later use. It fills the top-bar GPX chip (`#gpxChip`), the Difficulty
  stat tile (`#difficultyStat` + `#difficultyDetail`), and the climbs list
  inside the elevation card. `state.routeName` prefers a gallery ride's curated title,
  then the GPX's own `<name>` (`parseGpx` in `route.mjs` returns
  `{ points, name }`), then the uploaded filename, and is persisted/restored
  with the saved ride. `difficulty.mjs#classifyRoute` buckets distance,
  meters-of-climb-per-km, and "equivalent km" (distance + ascent ÷
  `EQUIVALENT_KM_CLIMB_METERS`) into named classes purely from distance and
  elevation gain — no power/speed/weight/weather data. `climbs.mjs#detectClimbs`
  walks the route once, extending a candidate climb through small dips
  (same noise-anchor idea as `enrichRoute`'s ascent counter, but with its own
  dedicated thresholds, deliberately decoupled from
  `CLIMB_NOISE_THRESHOLD_METERS`) and only closing it once elevation has
  dropped `CLIMB_DESCENT_TOLERANCE_METERS` below the peak *and* the route has
  moved `CLIMB_MERGE_GAP_METERS` past that peak — so a short flat stretch or
  a few meters of downhill doesn't end a climb; candidates under
  `CLIMB_MIN_GAIN_METERS` or `CLIMB_MIN_AVERAGE_GRADE_PERCENT` are dropped as
  noise. All thresholds live in `tuning.mjs`. `updateClimbStatus` (`climbs-ui.mjs`,
  called from `updateRideUi` on the same slow-UI cadence as the other live
  stats) looks up `state.progressMeters` against `state.climbs` each tick: if
  progress falls inside a climb's `[startDistanceMeters, endDistanceMeters]`
  it reports that climb's remaining distance/ascent/grade and highlights it
  in the climbs list; otherwise it reports the next upcoming climb and the
  distance to it. It never re-detects climbs itself — the tolerance already
  baked into `detectClimbs`'s boundaries is what keeps this from flickering
  on GPX noise.
- **Custom profile segments.** A click on the elevation profile still seeks the
  rider. A horizontal drag across the profile selects an arbitrary route
  segment, using `PROFILE_SEGMENT_SELECTION_*` thresholds in `tuning.mjs` to
  avoid accidental tiny selections. While a custom segment is selected, the
  normal profile hover readout is disabled and that same canvas readout style is
  reused for segment stats: start, stop, length, ascent, and descent. A normal
  click on the profile clears the custom selection and then seeks as usual.
  While stationary in overview, selecting a segment seeks to its start,
  highlights it on the profile and 3D route, and enters the same focused camera
  stack used by detected climbs (`static`, `orbit`, or `satellite`, controlled
  by `climbFocusMode`). While moving, it does not change camera mode; it keeps
  the rider camera/follow behavior and shows only the segment stats in the map
  HUD banner. A selected custom segment is not added to `state.climbs` and must
  not affect climb detection/status.
- **First-open auto-load & route deep-link**: with no saved ride and a working
  map, `initGallery` loads the first gallery route automatically
  (`shouldAutoLoadFirst` in `app.js`'s `startApp`); it is skipped when the map/API key
  is missing so the first-run key prompt stays front and center. Opening the
  app with a `?route=<gallery-id>` query (the landing page's "Launch GPX Rider"
  button uses `app.html?route=0050_jested`) forces that specific gallery route
  on load — ahead of both a restored saved ride and the auto-load-first — via
  `getRequestedRouteId` passed to `initGallery`. An absent or unknown id just
  falls through to the normal behavior.
- **Units**: all internal values are metric (meters, km/h, kcal). Only
  format at the display edge via `units.mjs`.
- **BLE**: FTMS control-point writes must go through the write queue in
  `trainer.mjs` (one GATT operation at a time) and grade writes are
  throttled/averaged — read the comments there before changing timing.
- **3D map geometry**: never render lines with `CLAMP_TO_GROUND` — draped
  strokes smear down steep slopes into wide blobs. The route line floats at
  `ROUTE_LINE_ALTITUDE_METERS` (2.5m) with its path densified (`densifyRoute`)
  so elevated segments follow the terrain.
  The rider dot is a `Model3DElement` loading the model at
  `RIDER_DOT_MODEL_PATH` (`tuning.mjs`; see `renderRiderDot`/`updateRiderDot`
  in `route-render.mjs`), **not** a `Polygon3DElement` and **not** a
  `Marker3DElement`/`PinElement` billboard — both were tried first, in that
  order, and both were confirmed by real-browser testing (not just reasoned
  about) to fail:
  - `Polygon3DElement`: meant for static terrain-draped areas, not a point
    that moves every frame. Re-tessellating one every frame produced a
    solid-black fill at ordinary follow-camera distances — independent of
    polygon winding, altitude/z-fighting with terrain (tried 1–20m up), and
    `extruded: true` (a short cylinder instead of a flat disc) — plus a
    faceted/streaky look from the constant re-triangulation.
  - `Marker3DElement` + `PinElement`: fixed the black-fill and faceting, but
    a `PinElement` reads as a map-pin/teardrop, not a location dot, and its
    `scale` is a screen-space billboard size that doesn't grow/shrink with
    camera distance the way a real ground object should.

  A real mesh avoids all of that. The shipped model, `app/assets/rider-dot.glb`,
  is hand-rolled by `scripts/generate_rider_dot_model.py` (no 3D modeling
  tool available in this environment — the same "encode the binary format by
  hand" approach `app/fit.mjs` takes for FIT files): a two-material puck,
  baked to a true 1 meter diameter so `RIDER_DOT_SCALE` in `tuning.mjs` is a
  plain real-world size multiplier. Both materials use the
  `KHR_materials_unlit` glTF extension — an ordinary lit PBR material
  rendered solid black here regardless of normals/winding/doubleSided/
  texturing (confirmed by testing many variants), and unlit is also the
  semantically correct choice for a location marker anyway: it must stay
  clearly visible at any time of day or camera angle, not dim to black in
  shadow like a real physical object would. `RIDER_DOT_MODEL_PATH`,
  `RIDER_DOT_ORIENTATION`, `RIDER_DOT_SCALE`, and `RIDER_DOT_ALTITUDE_METERS`
  (`tuning.mjs`) are all independently tunable specifically so a different
  model can be dropped into `app/assets/` and pointed at without touching
  `route-render.mjs` — see the comments on those constants for what to expect when
  swapping models (orientation and unlit materials both being the most
  likely things a new model needs). `RIDER_DOT_ALTITUDE_METERS` puts the dot
  on the ground and is deliberately independent of `ROUTE_LINE_ALTITUDE_METERS`
  — the route line has to float clear of the terrain because a drawn line
  clamped to the ground smears down slopes, but a real mesh doesn't have that
  problem. It's not 0 though: the shipped puck's origin is at its vertical
  center, so 0 buried its bottom half in the terrain, and clipping didn't
  fully stop until well past just the model's own half-height — most likely
  because the terrain mesh itself isn't perfectly smooth/precise at close
  range (confirmed by testing on a steep switchback, where clipping is most
  visible). Needs retuning alongside `RIDER_DOT_MODEL_PATH` for a model with
  different dimensions or an off-center origin — start from that model's own
  half-height above 0 and increase from there if it still clips. A
  `Polyline3DElement` ring (via `riderCircleCoordinates`, whose winding must
  trace counter-clockwise as seen from above — see its comment) is the fallback for
  browsers without `Model3DElement`. The dot (and the minimap marker) mirrors
  the brand "GPX Rider" logo dot — a solid amber center with a paler amber
  ring — via the model's two materials and, for the minimap and fallback
  ring, the `RIDER_DOT_COLOR` constant in `route-render.mjs`. The rider beacon is a
  real-world-sized extruded `Polygon3DElement` cylinder with
  `drawsOccludedSegments` so trees never hide the rider's position; it is
  **off by default** (`DEFAULT_BEACON_ENABLED`), opt-in from the Rendering
  settings — unlike the dot, it hasn't shown the same black-fill issue, but
  it's also large enough that a small-on-screen-footprint problem wouldn't
  reproduce the same way, and if it ever does, the fix here is the same:
  switch it to a `Model3DElement` too, not more polygon tweaking.
- **Camera modes & physical motion**: `state.overviewActive` is true by
  default after a route loads, and `state.cameraMode` is `"overview"` while the
  route overview is actually driving the map (whole route framed via
  `computeRouteOverviewCamera`
  in `camera.mjs`: the framing axis is the route's *principal axis of spread*
  — a PCA over all points, not the start→end line, so loops/lollipops/
  out-and-backs still frame along their real long dimension instead of an
  arbitrary near-zero start→end axis — with that long axis horizontal, the
  route's far side facing away, and start-left/end-right for open routes). The
  overview's tilt, side and distance are tunable in `tuning.mjs`
  (`OVERVIEW_TILT_DEGREES`, `OVERVIEW_HEADING_OFFSET_DEGREES`,
  `OVERVIEW_MARGIN_FACTOR`, `OVERVIEW_RANGE_FACTOR`,
  `OVERVIEW_MIN/MAX_RANGE_METERS`, all passed through from `enterOverviewMode`).
  `headingOffsetDegrees` rotates the whole view on top of the auto-picked side
  (180 = view from the exact opposite side, long axis still horizontal; other
  values swing the azimuth freely — the fit reruns against the final heading so
  the route stays framed at any offset). The fit always frames the whole route;
  `rangeFactor` (<1) and
  `maxRangeMeters` pull the camera in closer at the cost of cropping the route
  — the lever for a lower, terrain-rich view, since Google's 3D map limits how
  far it will tilt toward the horizon at the large range a whole-route fit
  needs (use the Debug camera overlay to see the tilt it actually applies).
  Grabbing the map while an overview is showing turns the overview **off**:
  `endUserInteraction` clears `overviewActive`, drops any animated driver, and
  sets `state.cameraMode` to `"manual"` (the overview button goes inactive).
  The overview is **never force-disabled by movement**: the
  automatic transitions are "route loaded → overview on", "movement
  started (pedal or sim) → overview off" (the auto-off lives in
  `ensureMovementLoop`, which flips to `"follow"` and clears `overviewActive` /
  the animated driver once), and "ride just finished → finish-line orbit on"
  (see below). Any other time — including mid-ride — the user may
  toggle the overview on or off; showing it while riding is a deliberate choice
  and does nothing to the ride. A static/satellite overview kept up while riding
  is driven by the movement loop's own `updateMapCamera`→`stepCameraFlight`
  chase toward `state.overviewCamera`; an animated one keeps running its own
  loop (which no longer bails on `movementLoopActive`), and `updateMapCamera`
  yields whenever `state.overviewAnim` is set so the two never fight. The
  overview snaps into place instantly on load
  (`applyCameraNow` — a new route may be across the
  world); every later camera move chases the target's eye/look-at pair with
  bounded acceleration (`chaseStep` + `chaseTuning` in `camera.mjs`: the
  acceleration budget grows with remaining distance, so follow tracking is
  gentle while transition flights are fast, braking to arrive), stepped by
  the movement loop while riding and by `ensureCameraFlightLoop` otherwise.
- **Map overview control.** The map action bar has a split translucent overview
  control: the plane button toggles `state.overviewActive` and switches between
  the selected overview and rider camera; the chevron opens the same
  `"static"`/`"orbit"`/`"flyby"`/`"flyover"`/`"satellite"`/`"satellite-north"`
  choices as the Camera & view settings select. The split control is amber while
  overview is active. The toggle button is only disabled when no route is loaded
  — never during a ride (`canToggle = hasRoute` in `syncOverviewControls`).
  Picking a mode from the dropdown activates overview whether parked or riding
  (a deliberate choice); changing the settings select only reframes immediately
  if overview is already active. The map reset camera button
  (`#resetCameraViewBtn`) is fully decoupled from the overview: it only resets
  the follow-camera offsets/zoom/angle and, when the rider camera is the active
  surface, flies it back — it never activates or deactivates an overview (an
  active overview is left running). It is **disabled whenever the camera is
  already at its defaults** (`cameraAtDefaults` in `camera-ui.mjs` — all offsets at
  default and `cameraMode !== "manual"`, i.e. pressing it would change nothing)
  and enables once a drag captures new offsets or leaves the camera in
  `"manual"`. `syncResetCameraButton` (called from `syncOverviewControls` and
  the camera-slider handler) keeps that state in sync.
- **Overview motion modes** (`state.overviewMode`, a persisted user setting in
  Settings › Camera & view, default `DEFAULT_OVERVIEW_MODE` in `tuning.mjs`):
  `"static"` is the framed still (the `ensureCameraFlightLoop` path above);
  `"satellite"` and `"satellite-north"` are also static stills but looking
  nearly straight down (`SATELLITE_TILT_DEGREES`) with the route framed as large
  as it fits (`SATELLITE_MARGIN_FACTOR`) — `"satellite"` keeps the route's long
  axis horizontal (the default PCA orientation), `"satellite-north"` forces a
  due-north heading via `computeRouteOverviewCamera`'s `headingDegrees` override;
  `"orbit"`, `"flyby"` and `"flyover"` are *animated* and driven through a
  separate `ensureOverviewAnimationLoop`/`stepOverviewAnimation` loop that writes
  the map camera **directly** every frame (the motion is already smooth, so
  there is no chase). `enterOverviewMode` picks per-mode fit params
  (`overviewCameraParams`) and still computes the static `state.overviewCamera`
  (orbit spins its heading via `orbitCamera`; it's also the fly modes' fallback),
  then `startOverviewAnimation` takes over for animated modes — building a
  `createEllipseFlyby` driver for `"flyby"` or a `createFigureEightFlyover`
  driver for `"flyover"` (both return `false` and fall back to static if the
  route is too small to fly). Both animation and the static flight
  write `state.map` directly, so only one runs at a time (`enterOverviewMode`
  starts exactly one; `startOverviewAnimation` nulls `state.cameraFlight`). The
  animated loop self-exits the instant the camera leaves overview — grabbing the
  map (`endUserInteraction` → `"manual"`) or movement starting (`"follow"`) —
  and eases in from the current pose over `OVERVIEW_ANIM_INTRO_SECONDS` so
  switching modes never jumps. The ellipse fly-by (`app/flyby.mjs`, configured by
  `ELLIPSE_FLYBY` in `tuning.mjs`) fits a PCA-aligned ellipse to the route
  footprint, scales it independently of the route bounds, enforces
  `minTurnRadiusMeters`, and supports `direction` (`1` clockwise seen from
  above, `-1` counter-clockwise). Its camera looks along the direction of travel
  and pitches down by `mountPitchDegrees`; `secondsPerLap`, `maxSpeedMps`,
  `flyHeightMetersMin`, `flyHeightMetersAboveTerrainMin`, `cameraFovDegrees`,
  `inwardLookDegrees`, `viewDistanceMeters`, `ellipseScale`, `minSemiMajorMeters`,
  `minSemiMinorMeters`, `sampleCount`, and `startAngleDegrees` are all tunable.
  `inwardLookDegrees` rotates the horizontal look direction toward the ellipse
  interior (clockwise = right, counter-clockwise = left), while the route travel
  direction still drives the baseline heading.
  The actual fly height is the higher of the baseline height and the height
  needed to clear the highest route elevation sample under the fitted ellipse by
  `flyHeightMetersAboveTerrainMin`. `maxBankDegrees` scales the bank angle from
  the current turn radius
  (`minTurnRadiusMeters` = max bank), and `overview-camera.mjs` applies it to `state.map.roll`.
  Fly-over (`createFigureEightFlyover`) reuses the exact same footprint fit,
  `ELLIPSE_FLYBY` config, and camera-frame/pacing driver — only the path differs:
  a Gerono figure-eight (`along = a·cos u`, `cross = b·sin 2u`) that crosses the
  footprint center twice per lap. Every tunable above applies identically, with
  one behavioral twist: because the eight *changes turn direction* between its
  two lobes, `bankAt`/`inwardLookDegrees` follow the **local** turn (via the
  curve's `signedCurvatureAt` and the `tracksTurnDirection` flag) instead of the
  ellipse's fixed handedness — so the camera banks and looks into whichever turn
  it is actually in (right on one lobe, left on the other) and eases smoothly
  through straight-ahead at each center crossing, where the path is momentarily
  straight. The ellipse fly-by is unchanged (constant `direction`).
  The red debug line shown while the camera debug overlay is active is shared
  by orbit, fly-by and fly-over and tuned by `OVERVIEW_DEBUG_LINE_COLOR`,
  `OVERVIEW_DEBUG_LINE_WIDTH`, `OVERVIEW_DEBUG_LINE_ALTITUDE_METERS`, and
  `OVERVIEW_DEBUG_LINE_SAMPLE_COUNT`.
- **Finish-line orbit.** The instant a ride — pedaled, simulated, or demo —
  reaches the end of the route (the finish check inside `tick`, `movement.mjs`),
  `enterFinishOrbit` takes the camera into an orbit around the rider's exact
  final position, instead of freezing on the follow camera's last frame. It
  reuses the same animated-orbit driver as the overview modes above (same
  intro ease-in from wherever the camera was, same exit on a manual map drag
  or the overview toggle) but does not go through `computeRouteOverviewCamera`
  — the "route" at a finish point has no spread to fit a PCA axis to, so it
  builds the base camera directly (`center` at the finish point plus
  `FINISH_ORBIT_LOOKAT_HEIGHT_METERS`, `FINISH_ORBIT_TILT_DEGREES`,
  `FINISH_ORBIT_RANGE_METERS`), with an initial heading sampled the same way
  the follow camera does (`HEADING_SAMPLE_METERS` back from the finish point).
  `state.finishOrbitActive` distinguishes it from a normal whole-route orbit so
  `stepOverviewAnimation` spins it at its own `FINISH_ORBIT_SECONDS_PER_REV` /
  `FINISH_ORBIT_DIRECTION` instead of the whole-route or climb-focus orbit
  speeds; any later call into `enterOverviewMode` (a manual overview toggle, a
  climb/segment focus, resetting the ride, loading a new route) clears the flag
  and supersedes it, same as grabbing the map does. Toggle via
  `DEFAULT_FINISH_ORBIT_ENABLED`; all the geometry knobs above live in
  `tuning.mjs`.
- **Camera terrain avoidance** lifts the follow camera when its eye would
  sink below terrain + clearance and eases it back down as terrain allows
  (`currentTerrainLift` in `follow-camera.mjs`; pure math in `camera.mjs`'s
  `applyCameraLift`). The terrain estimate is `maxElevationNear` over the
  route's own elevation points — deliberately **not** the Google Elevation
  API, which would cost real money at follow-camera query rates. Keep it
  that way.

## Persistence

`app/storage.mjs` keeps everything in IndexedDB (database `gpx-rider`,
object store `kv`), fronted by an in-memory cache that `initStorage()`
loads once — `startApp()` awaits it before anything reads — so
`readJson`/`writeJson`/`removeStored` stay synchronous for callers.
Records saved by older versions in localStorage are migrated into
IndexedDB on first load; browsers without working IndexedDB fall back to
localStorage transparently. Keys: `gpx-rider:settings`,
`gpx-rider:last-ride` (route + progress), `gpx-rider:ride-log` (recorded
samples), `gpx-rider:last-trainer`, `gpx-rider:last-heart-rate`. The one
deliberate exception is `gpx-rider:maps-api-key`, which stays in
localStorage (handled directly in `map-init.mjs`): saving it reloads the page
immediately, and only a synchronous write is guaranteed to survive that.
Never send any of these anywhere; the app's privacy story is "everything
stays in the browser".

## Deployed Maps API key

The live GitHub Pages demo works without a visitor pasting a key: the
`MAPS_API_KEY` repository secret (an HTTP referrer-restricted key, scoped to
the Pages origin) is base64-encoded and baked into `app/config.mjs` at
deploy time by `scripts/inject_maps_api_key.py`, run from `deploy-pages.yml`
before the Pages artifact is uploaded. The encoding is cosmetic — a webapp's
key is always visible in the network tab regardless — it just keeps the raw
key out of the JS source as a greppable literal. `map-init.mjs`'s
`resolveMapsApiKey()` prefers a key a visitor saved in Settings over this
default, so self-hosters and forks without the secret get the exact same
"paste your key" flow as before — `app/config.mjs` just stays empty. When a
deployed key is present, `startApp()` hides the whole API-key section in
Settings (`els.apiKeySection`) instead of showing an empty field nobody
needs. Never widen the referrer restriction beyond the exact deployed
origin, and don't add a second, unrestricted key anywhere in the client
bundle. The landing page (`landing.mjs`) resolves the key the same way —
visitor's saved key, else the baked-in `config.mjs` key — so it lights up on
the live demo and in local dev without any separate wiring.

`inject_maps_api_key.py` also injects the optional `HEAD` repository variable
(deployment-only tags such as analytics) right after `<head>` in
`app/index.html`, which is now the **landing page** — the public entry point,
so that is where such tags belong.

**Local dev key.** For local development the map needs a key too, but it must
never be committed. `scripts/dev_server.py` injects a *local* key into the
`app/config.mjs` it serves (the on-disk file stays the empty default), using
the same base64 substitution as the deploy script. The key is read from the
`MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable, or from a `.maps-api-key` file at the repo
root — both are gitignored (`.maps-api-key` is in `.gitignore`) and must stay
out of git. With neither present the served config stays empty and the app
falls back to the Settings "paste your key" prompt, exactly as in a fork.
**If you're set up on a machine where `.maps-api-key` is missing (a fresh
clone — the file is intentionally not in git), ask the user for their Google
Maps API key and write it to `.maps-api-key` at the repo root** (a single line,
no quotes); then `make run` / the preview server will pick it up. Never paste a
key into a tracked file or commit it.

## Documentation duties

- **Keep `README.md` updated.** Any user-visible feature, limitation, or
  workflow change must be reflected in the README (Features, How to use it,
  Notes & limitations). The README is the project's landing page; stale
  docs are treated as bugs.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` synchronized. Any change to one
  agent-instruction file must be reflected in the other in the same change
  (preserving only filename-specific titles if needed).
- Keep these files updated when the architecture or conventions change.
- Gallery route text and preview framing live in `gallery/*/metadata.json`.
  Use the setup page's Export to gallery card to copy the current map camera
  into that file, then run `make gallery-data`. The README does not contain a
  generated route gallery.

## Testing & manual verification

- Unit tests cover the pure modules (`camera`, `route`, `units`, `fit`,
  `eta`). Add tests alongside any new pure logic.
- Web Bluetooth requires Chrome/Edge; hardware paths can't be unit-tested.
  When changing `trainer.mjs`/`heartrate.mjs`, preserve the existing
  logging (`[trainer]` console.debug lines) — it's the only field
  diagnostics available.
- The deployed site is GitHub Pages via
  `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` (deploys `app/` on push to `main`).
